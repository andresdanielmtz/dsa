# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Personal Repository

Personal repository for storage (and lookup) purposes. It will be updated as I learn more about Data Structures & Algorithms (and practice leetcode too). Might get changed to public for people to see.

> Another related repository is [andresdanielmtz/oracle-exercises](https://github.com/andresdanielmtz/oracle-exercises). It is more focused on leetcode problems and exercises.

Folder `tc2038b` contains the exercises and projects done during the course **TC2038B: Analysis of Advanced Algorithms**.
