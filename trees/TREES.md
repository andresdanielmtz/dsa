# Trees

There are various types of binary trees.

- **Binary Search Tree**: Each node has up to two children; left < parent < right.
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree for fast lookups.
- **Red Black Tree**: Balanced BST with color properties for efficient operations.
- **Segment Tree**: Tree for range queries and updates on arrays.
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Efficient structure for prefix sums.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Tree for storing strings, useful for search and autocomplete.
- **Heap (Priority Queue)**: Tree-based structure for fast access to min/max element.
- **Splay Tree**: BST that moves accessed elements closer to the root.
- **B-Tree**: Multi-way search tree optimized for disk storage.
- **K-D Tree**: Space-partitioning tree for organizing points in k dimensions.
- **Suffix Tree**: Tree for fast substring search in strings.
- **Interval Tree**: Tree for storing intervals and querying overlapping intervals.

Will try to implement some of these in the future.
